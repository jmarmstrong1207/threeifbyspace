## Synopsis

The Silicon Valley project is being undertaken by the development team Uncodables, comprised of undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento.

The clientâ€™s business currently has a website, but not a mobile application. The website provides two sections: An article/blog section for users to read and a shop section for users to purchase items. Articles/blogs are about things such as TV/Movies, Manga, and Anime. The shop sells items such as Funko pops, pins, plushies, board games, and figurines.

In order to expand his business and user base, he would like to have a mobile app that is representative of what the website looks like, supporting both the article and shop section, preferably supporting both Android and iOS.

The mobile application name would be ThreeIfBySpaceApp.
Silicon Valley project is to create a mobile application for Three If By Space using Flutter as the framework.
